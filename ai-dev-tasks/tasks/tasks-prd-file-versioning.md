## Relevant Files

- `src/obsidian_sync.py` - Main file containing the file saving logic - Added `get_unique_filename` method and updated `save_meeting` to use versioning
- `tests/test_obsidian_sync.py` - Test file - Updated duplicate test and added 6 new tests for versioning functionality
- `README.md` - Project documentation - Added file versioning to key features section
- `ai-dev-tasks/tasks/versioning-test-results.md` - Integration test documentation - Created to document test results

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- This project uses pytest, so run tests with `python -m pytest` from the virtual environment

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Implement unique filename generation logic
  - [x] 1.1 Create a new method `get_unique_filename(self, base_path: Path) -> Path` in ObsidianSync class
  - [x] 1.2 Implement logic to check if base_path exists using `Path.exists()`
  - [x] 1.3 If file exists, extract the base name and extension using Path methods
  - [x] 1.4 Implement loop to find next available version number by checking (1), (2), etc.
  - [x] 1.5 Return the unique path with appropriate version suffix

- [x] 2.0 Update save_meeting method to use versioning
  - [x] 2.1 Modify `save_meeting` to call `get_unique_filename` before writing
  - [x] 2.2 Update the file writing logic to use the unique filename
  - [x] 2.3 Update logging to show the actual filename used (including version if applicable)
  - [x] 2.4 Ensure the method returns the actual path where the file was saved

- [x] 3.0 Remove obsolete duplicate checking code
  - [x] 3.1 Remove the unused `check_duplicate` method from ObsidianSync class
  - [x] 3.2 Remove any references to duplicate checking in comments or docstrings

- [x] 4.0 Update and add tests for versioning functionality
  - [x] 4.1 Fix `test_save_meeting_duplicate` to expect versioned file creation instead of None
  - [x] 4.2 Add test `test_get_unique_filename_no_conflict` for files that don't exist
  - [x] 4.3 Add test `test_get_unique_filename_single_conflict` for first version (1)
  - [x] 4.4 Add test `test_get_unique_filename_multiple_conflicts` for multiple versions
  - [x] 4.5 Add test `test_save_meeting_creates_versioned_files` to verify full flow
  - [x] 4.6 Add test for edge case where versioned files already exist out of sequence

- [x] 5.0 Verify integration with re-processing workflow
  - [x] 5.1 Create a manual test scenario by removing an entry from processed_meetings.json
  - [x] 5.2 Run the sync and verify a versioned file is created
  - [x] 5.3 Verify the state manager correctly tracks the re-processed meeting
  - [x] 5.4 Document the testing process and results
