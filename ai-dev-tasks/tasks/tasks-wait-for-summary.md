## Relevant Files

- `src/fireflies_client.py` - Contains the Fireflies API client and GraphQL queries; updated to include summary_status field and readiness check methods (is_summary_ready and get_meeting_with_summary_check).
- `tests/test_fireflies_client.py` - Unit tests for the Fireflies client functionality; expanded with comprehensive tests for summary readiness methods.
- `src/main.py` - Contains the main processing logic; updated to check summary readiness before processing meetings and skip non-ready meetings without marking them as processed.
- `tests/test_main_summary_processing.py` - Integration tests for the main processing loop with summary readiness checking functionality.
- `README.md` - Updated with comprehensive documentation of the Summary Readiness Feature including how it works, benefits, and status logging examples.
- `ai-notes/fireflies-api.md` - Updated API documentation to include summary status checking functionality with implementation patterns and benefits.

### Notes

- The existing GraphQL query in `fireflies_client.py` needs to be updated to include the `meeting_info.summary_status` field
- Summary status can be: 'processing', 'processed', 'failed', or 'skipped' - only 'processed' should be considered ready
- Use `python -m pytest tests/` to run all tests, or `python -m pytest tests/test_fireflies_client.py` for specific test files
- Meetings with non-ready summaries should be skipped but NOT marked as processed so they can be retried in future polling cycles

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Update GraphQL Query to Include Summary Status
  - [x] 1.1 Modify `GET_TRANSCRIPT_DETAILS_QUERY` in `src/fireflies_client.py` to include `meeting_info { fred_joined silent_meeting summary_status }` field
  - [x] 1.2 Verify the updated query returns the summary_status field when tested against the Fireflies API
  - [x] 1.3 Update any type hints or documentation comments related to the meeting data structure

- [x] 2.0 Add Summary Readiness Check Methods
  - [x] 2.1 Create `is_summary_ready(self, meeting_data: Dict) -> bool` method in `FirefliesClient` class
  - [x] 2.2 Implement logic to check if `meeting_info.summary_status == 'processed'`
  - [x] 2.3 Create `get_meeting_with_summary_check(self, meeting_id: str) -> Optional[Dict]` method that only returns meetings with ready summaries
  - [x] 2.4 Add appropriate logging for meetings that are not ready (include current status in log message)
  - [x] 2.5 Handle edge cases where `meeting_info` or `summary_status` fields might be missing

- [x] 3.0 Update Main Processing Logic
  - [x] 3.1 Modify the meeting processing loop in `process_meetings()` function in `src/main.py`
  - [x] 3.2 Replace direct `get_meeting()` calls with `get_meeting_with_summary_check()` calls
  - [x] 3.3 Add logic to skip meetings whose summaries aren't ready and log appropriate messages
  - [x] 3.4 Ensure meetings with non-ready summaries are not marked as processed so they can be retried in future polling cycles
  - [x] 3.5 Update any related logging to indicate when meetings are skipped due to summary not being ready

- [x] 4.0 Add Unit Tests
  - [x] 4.1 Create test cases for `is_summary_ready()` method with different summary_status values ('processing', 'processed', 'failed', 'skipped')
  - [x] 4.2 Create test cases for `get_meeting_with_summary_check()` method with ready and non-ready meetings
  - [x] 4.3 Create test cases for handling missing `meeting_info` or `summary_status` fields
  - [x] 4.4 Add integration tests to verify the main processing loop correctly skips non-ready meetings
  - [x] 4.5 Test that meetings with ready summaries are processed normally

- [x] 5.0 Documentation and Testing
  - [x] 5.1 Update README.md or relevant documentation to explain the summary readiness checking feature
  - [x] 5.2 Test the implementation with recent meetings to verify summary status checking works correctly
  - [x] 5.3 Update any API documentation or comments to reflect the new summary status checking functionality
