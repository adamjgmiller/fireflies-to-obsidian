# File Versioning Integration Test Results

## Test Scenario
Tested the file versioning feature by simulating a re-processing scenario where a meeting is removed from the processed list and then re-synced.

## Test Steps

1. **Selected Test Meeting**
   - Meeting ID: `01JTKYE6YJ9783Y450S8C1BHDY`
   - Original file: `2025-05-08-13-00-Weekly-Internal-Team-Meeting.md`
   - Location: `/Users/adammiller/Obsidian Primary Vault/Primary Vault/Fireflies/`

2. **Removed from Processed List**
   - Backed up `.state/processed_meetings.json`
   - Removed the meeting ID from the processed meetings array

3. **Ran Sync in Test Mode**
   - Command: `python -m src.main --test 01JTKYE6YJ9783Y450S8C1BHDY`
   - The sync successfully detected the meeting as unprocessed
   - Downloaded and created a new file with version suffix

4. **Verified Results**
   - Original file preserved: `2025-05-08-13-00-Weekly-Internal-Team-Meeting.md` (61,299 bytes)
   - New versioned file created: `2025-05-08-13-00-Weekly-Internal-Team-Meeting (1).md` (61,426 bytes)
   - Meeting ID re-added to processed list
   - Log showed: "Meeting saved successfully: 2025-05-08-13-00-Weekly-Internal-Team-Meeting (1).md (original: 2025-05-08-13-00-Weekly-Internal-Team-Meeting.md)"

## Test Outcome
âœ… **SUCCESS** - The versioning feature works as expected:
- No data loss (original file preserved)
- Automatic version numbering for duplicates
- Seamless integration with existing sync workflow
- Clear logging of versioned files

## Additional Observations
- The file sizes differ slightly (127 bytes) likely due to timestamp differences in the frontmatter
- The versioning logic correctly identifies the next available version number
- The state management continues to work correctly with versioned files
