You, I, and our development team are following a process where - except for very small tasks or changes - we always:
1. Create a PRD following the rules in '/ai-dev-tasks/create-prd.mdc' and put it in '/ai-dev-tasks/tasks'
2. Use that PRD to create a task list following the rules in '/ai-dev-tasks/generate-tasks.mdc'
3. When the user asks you to do a task, if it is related to a task list, immediately review and follow the rules in '/ai-dev-tasks/process-task-list.mdc'

If we ask for a PRD, mention a PRD, or talk about a task list, those are most likely the lists we are talking about.
